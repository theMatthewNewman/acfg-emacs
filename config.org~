** Spacemacs Theme
Works great for me. 
Nothing complicated just a nice default theme.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package spacemacs-theme
    :ensure t
    :init
    (load-theme 'spacemacs-dark t))
#+end_src


* Interface Settings
Basic settings that don't require package installation.
An example is removing the scroll bar.
* Navigation
* Text Manipulation
* Completion
* Syntax checking
